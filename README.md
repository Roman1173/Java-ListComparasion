It is necessary to write code that would call the main methods of collections a certain (1000 or 2000, or any other) number of times. At the same time, the time must be recorded. It is minimally necessary to test the methods:add, delete, get. After that, a table with the results is displayed (method, how many times it was executed, execution time)
